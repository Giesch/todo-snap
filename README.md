# todo-snap

## Description

An example REST API for managing todos.

To run locally, you'll need an instance of postgres. You can bring one up with docker by using the command:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

on linux (with an older docker installation), or:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

on a mac (with a newer docker installation). Then follow the 'developing' heading from the duct readme below.

## Routes

| name     | route                   | description                                                                         |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| list     | GET "/todos/{email}"    | Returns a list of todos for a given user                                            |
| create   | POST "/todos"           | Creates a new incomplete todo with a given title for a given user                   |
| update   | PUT "/todos"            | Updates the title or completed status for a specific todo belonging to a given user |
| delete   | DELETE "/todos"         | Deletes a todo matching an id/email pair (using an improper delete body)            |
| summary  | GET "/summary/{email}"  | Returns complete/incomplete todo counts for a given user                            |
| burndown | GET "/burndown/{email}" | Returns an array of todo events with a running burndown total of incomplete todos   |

The json for a single returned todo looks like:

```json
{
  "id": "a45fe0de-6707-4de2-804f-6527feb90fb6",
  "title": "bake cookies",
  "complete": false
}
```

Where "id" is a generated uuid, "title" is a user-specified text field, and "complete" is the current status of the todo (which defaults to false).

The json returned by the summary endpoint looks like:

```json
{
  "complete": 10,
  "incomplete": 20
}
```

Where "complete" is the current number of completed and undeleted todos, and "incomplete" is the current number of incomplete and undeleted todos.

The json returned by the burndown endpoint is an array of events that look like:

```json
{
  "burndownTotal": 3,
  "change": 1,
  "prevComplete": null,
  "complete": false,
  "op": "insert",
  "id": "21481d03-a2f4-4ce5-97f3-0e45c4eedf38",
  "title": "bake cookies",
  "updatedAt": "2021-11-18T07:04:48Z"
}
```

Each event represents a change to the database. The "burndownTotal" is the number of incomplete, undeleted todos that existed after the event occurred. The "change" is change this event caused to the "burndownTotal". The fields "prevComplete" and "complete" represent the completed status of the todo before and after the event, respectively. While the "complete" field is always non-null, "prevComplete" can be null for an insert. The "op" field is an enum of 'insert', 'update', and 'delete', represeting the type of change. The "id" is the id of the todo, and the "title" is the title of the todo after the event; an update could have modified the status and the title. The "updatedAt" field is the time that the event occurred. All fields except "prevComplete" are guaranteed to be non-null.

## Things I'd like to fix

1. Integration tests
   I was hoping duct would help with this. I'm guessing there's nice patterns for doing it. But judging from github issues, I think I'd have to ask for advice in the clojurians slack, which didn't seem appropriate for this exercise.

2. Structured documentation
   I'd like to try out reitit and its swagger integration.

3. Datomic implementation
   My original stretch goal was to add a datomic implementation at the end, but I'm adding docs and tests instead.

4. Use coercers in the router
   The validation for uuids is currently duplicated. It looks like reitit and malli have a nice solution for this.

# Generated Duct README

## Developing

### Setup

When you first clone this repository, run:

```sh
lein duct setup
```

This will create files for local configuration, and prep your system
for the project.

### Environment

To begin developing, start with a REPL.

```sh
lein repl
```

Then load the development environment.

```clojure
user=> (dev)
:loaded
```

Run `go` to prep and initiate the system.

```clojure
dev=> (go)
:duct.server.http.jetty/starting-server {:port 3000}
:initiated
```

By default this creates a web server at <http://localhost:3000>.

When you make changes to your source files, use `reset` to reload any
modified files and reset the server.

```clojure
dev=> (reset)
:reloading (...)
:resumed
```

### Testing

Testing is fastest through the REPL, as you avoid environment startup
time.

```clojure
dev=> (test)
...
```

But you can also run tests through Leiningen.

```sh
lein test
```
